# Proxmox CLI for remote management and go api client

I built this api client from scratch in order to write a [telmate/terraform-provider-proxmox] alternative for my homelab cuz i felt it lacked features i required, like Cloudflare Zero Trust integration and lxc commands exec support (not available yet).

For more information, read the full docs [here].
